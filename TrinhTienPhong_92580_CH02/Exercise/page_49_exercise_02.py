Problem:
      2.  Explain the differences between the data types int and float.
Solution:
    *   Difference:
        -   int = Integer type: is a number without a decimal point.
            + Integers can be described as whole numbers meaning that they do not have any fractional parts.
            + Integer data types can be represented in three number systems â€“ Decimal, Octal and Hexadecimal.
            + Generally, integer data types require 2 bytes of memory.
        -   float = Real number type: is the number with the decimal part after the floating point.
            + Float or floating point numbers possess a fixed specific number of bits which are arranged for the whole
             number and the fractional portion of the number.
            + Float can be only written using a decimal number system.
            + Generally, float data types require 4 bytes of memory.
        *   Floats are used when more precision is needed.
