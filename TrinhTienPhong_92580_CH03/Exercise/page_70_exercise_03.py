Problem:
    3.  Explain the role of the variable in the header of a for loop.
Solution:
    Answer:
        A for loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration,
        and a body which is executed once per iteration.
        The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable,
        which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed.
