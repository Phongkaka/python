Problem:
    5.  What is the purpose of a main function?
* * * * * ============================================================================================= * * * * *
Solution:
    Result:
        The main function serves as the starting point for program execution. It usually controls program
        execution by directing the calls to other functions in the program. A program usually stops executing
        at the end of main, although it can terminate at other points in the program for a variety of reasons.
