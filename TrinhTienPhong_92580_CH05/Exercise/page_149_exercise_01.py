Problem:
    1.  What roles do the parameters and the return statement play in a function definition?
* * * * * ============================================================================================= * * * * *
Solution:
    Result:
        -   The return statement terminates the execution of a function and returns control to the calling function.
            Execution resumes in the calling function at the point immediately following the call. A return statement
            can also return a value to the calling function.
