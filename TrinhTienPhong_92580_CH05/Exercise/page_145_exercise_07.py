* * * * * ============================================================================================= * * * * *
Solution:
    Result:
        -   Aliasing can make the different signals for becoming in-distinguishable from one another.
        -   Aliasing can be reduced with the help of sampling, which is done at a higher rate than that
            of the Nyquist rate.
        -   Anti-aliasing technique is being used for eliminating the effect of overlaping of the frequency
            components.
